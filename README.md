Hi! I'm John. 

I'm currently working as a penetration tester while finishing up my bachelor's in cybersecurity. I need to work a bit more on my programming and figured 
I'd make some fun/useful projects with Python and commit them here.

Nothing here will be too overwhelming, but I hope to see my code advance over the next couple months.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
